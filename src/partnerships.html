            We are always looking for new people to partner with or to sponsor with servers. Are you developing a plugin but need somewhere to test it or do you have a YouTube channel that needs a community server? In either case we are looking to help people like you.
            We have already partnered with some leaders in the Minecraft community to help them grow and succeed, now its your turn. We are looking for the following types of people/communities to sponsor:

            <ul>
                <li>Plugin developers with original ideas or existing plugins that have potential to grow.</li>
                <li>YouTube channels with over 5,000 subscibers and who earn on average over 1,000 video views per day.</li>
                <li>Existing Minecraft communities that have existing users and are looking for ways to grow.</li>
                <li>Minecraft communities or events that benefit charity.</li>
            </ul>
