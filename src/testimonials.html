            	At Mineocity Hosting our only mission is to provide top notch, high-quality hosting, at an affordable price.
                Our team has been trained to recognize nearly any problem with the leading mod-packs and has played the games to understand how they work.
                As a result, our customers have a great experience, and have recognized us for facilitating it.

	                    I would strongly recomend them as a hosting site if you have a small group, or a large group.
	                    It's a great way to get together in minecraft with friends, the servers are well maintained,
	                    and no one has to leave the computer on all the time to worry about the world being accessed.

                    <p>As Owner of 3 Server inside the Mineocity Hosting company I'm very please in the service and the support this company give to SupremeCraft.
                    I started with 1 FTB server in the host, but faster i saw how the difference between hosts was.
                    In Mineocity the support with tickets and human quality is way Stronger than in other hosts i have try before.

	                    The servers themselves are great, no lag, easy FTP file access for backups all around just great.
	                    The support staff is incredibly helpful and went above and beyond my expectations any time I had an issue.
	                    All in all, I give you guys a 10/10.
